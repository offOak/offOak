                                This work uses tobacco to bring awareness to the missing and murdered Indigenous women, 
                                all who have experienced disproportionate violence. Within North American Indigenous peoples, 
                                tobacco (nicotiana rustica) has been used for centuries as a medicine with cultural and spiritual importance. 
                                It is prescribed to promote physical, spiritual, emotional, and community well-being. A gift of tobacco is a sign 
                                of respect and may be offered when asking for help, guidance, or protection to an elder or to the earth when 
                                using its resources.
                                <br><br>
                                For this installation, each pile of tobacco is an offering for each Indigenous woman who has been missing 
                                or murdered within Canada and the U.S. The missing and murdered Indigenous epidemic is a national crisis that 
                                currently affects Indigenous people in regions that include First Nations, Inuit, Metis (FNIM), and Native Alaskan 
                                communities. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2014 report, “Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational 
                                Overview”, found that thousands of Indigenous women were murdered over a span of thirty years. The homicide rate in Canada 
                                for Indigenous women was almost six times as high as the homicide rate for non-Indigenous women. Similar to Canada's situation, 
                                specific data on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in the U.S. has also been difficult to gather. May 5th is commemorated as 
                                National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.
